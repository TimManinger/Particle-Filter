In order to run this python3 code you will need the 
following modules in your PATH:

numpy
openCV-python

Once this is satisfied, simply run sim.py

CONTROLS:
Load and display next frame: Enter
Exit or close window: Escape

***
If you close the window with the x button the python process is stranded. OpenCV can't handle this and I don't want to learn GTK or QT just for that.
***

The coordinates in the bottom corner of the window are automatically generated by OpenCV when an image is displayed. I promise I'm using center origin coords in the code.
